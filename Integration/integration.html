          <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son
            and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond
            the world of known physics.

            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created
            in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential
            hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that
            exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously
            violent instant.

            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
            and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
            irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the
            ocean.

            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.

            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the
            Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South
            Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
            detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe
            being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second
            old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say,
            that Dr. Guth was correct.

            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
            whether it could ever be proved.

            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of
            dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and
            space and energy to science and speculation.

            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with
            its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
            architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of
            other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
          </p>
          <h2>‘As Big as It Gets’</h2>
          <p>
            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
            reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples
            would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
            general relativity, should ruffle space-time.

            Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said,
            “This is huge, as big as it gets.”

            He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
            gravitational waves.”

            The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates
            space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of
            the sun.

            Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic
            Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics
            here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

              <h3>The Theory of Inflation</h3>
              <small>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the
                universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</small>

                  <strong>THE UNIVERSE</strong> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way
                  galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a
                  mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.
                </div>
                <div>
                  <strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast
                  distance from one side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered
                  patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.
                </div>
                <div>
                  <strong>DISTANT COFFEE</strong> At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one
                  direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and
                  how much it has cooled.
                </div>
                <div>
                  <strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong> Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a
                  similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup
                  in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.

                  <strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place
                  to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee
                  pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.

                  <strong>INFLATION</strong> solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a
                  second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the
                  violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.
                </div>
                <div>
                  <strong>FLUCTUATION</strong> Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in
                  swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the
                  early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.
                </div>
                <div>
                  <strong>EXPANSION</strong> Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster
                  than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And
                  the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.
